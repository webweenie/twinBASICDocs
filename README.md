## [Controls](controls.md)
Controls are reusable components developers can use in their applications. Controls are often visible on the application form and provide an interaction for the user. However, some controls, the timer control for instance, are not visible to the end user. Using controls can significantly reduce the effort required to build an application in twinBASIC.

## [Objects](objects.md)
Operators are...

## [Collections](collections.md)
Collections are...

## [Properties](properties.md)
A property is an attribute of an object. Objects, such as controls, can have any number of attributes which can be set by using the appropriate property. For example, the TextBox control has a Text property that allows the TextBox to be populated.

## [Functions](functions.md)
Functions are...

## [Methods](methods.md)
Methods are...

## [Events](events.md)
Events are...

## [Statements](statements.md)
Statements are...

## [Keywords](keywords.md)
Keywords are...

## [Constants](constants.md)
trueBASIC has many built-in constants. Using constants, gives the developer a readable value that is easy to understand. Without constants, many properties would require integers to be used to represent the various states, making the code harder to write and understand later.

## [Operators](operators.md)
Operators are...

## [Types](types.md)
Types are...
