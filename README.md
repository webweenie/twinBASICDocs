# twinBASICDocs
twinBASIC is the most awesome programming language ever.

## [Controls](controls.md)
Controls are reusable components developers can use in their applications. Controls are often visible on the application form and provide an interaction for the user. However, some controls, the timer control for instance, are not visible to the end user. Using controls can significantly reduce the effort required to build an application in twinBASIC.

## [Objects](objects.md)
In object-oriented programming, an object is a combination of data and the code that acts upon that data. Objects protect their data by only allowing it to be accessed and changed in a defined set of ways. Command buttons, Forms, and entire applications are considered objects. Objects in the twinBASIC documentation include the various objects that don't fit into the object categories of Controls or Collections.

## [Collections](collections.md)
Collections are groups of items of the same type. Examples of collections include arrays, items in a list view, and the tabs in a tabstrip control.

## [Properties](properties.md)
A property is an attribute of an object. Objects, such as controls, can have any number of attributes which can be set by using the appropriate property. For example, the TextBox control has a Text property that allows the TextBox to be populated.

## [Functions](functions.md)
twinBASIC includes many built-in functions that simplify common tasks such as string manipulation, mathematical operations, and data type conversion. Functions return a value.

## [Methods](methods.md)
Methods are used to perform an action on an object.

## [Events](events.md)
Event procedures are special subroutines that objects call automatically when a pre-defined action occurs. 

## [Statements](statements.md)
Statements make up the core of the twinBASIC language. They include the tools needed to control the flow of the program logic, declare objects, and handle errors.

## [Keywords](keywords.md)
Keywords are words that are reserved by the twinBASIC language. 

## [Constants](constants.md)
trueBASIC has many built-in constants. Using constants, gives the developer a readable value that is easy to understand. Without constants, many properties would require integers to be used to represent the various states, making the code harder to write and understand later.

## [Operators](operators.md)
Operators perform an operation on one or more objects, properties, variables, constants, etc. Types of operators include arithmetic, assignment, comparison, concatenation, and logical.

## [Types](types.md)
Data types are used to limit the type of data that can exist in a variable, constant, or property; or be returned by a function. Limiting to only the type of data that is expected helps make applications more safe and easier to code.
