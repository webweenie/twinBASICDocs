twinBASIC is a modern version of the classic BASIC programming language. With twinBASIC we aim for 100% backwards compatibility with existing VB6 and VBA projects.

We aspire to offer a complete replacement development environment for classic BASIC projects whilst also bringing many new features and improvements over the old VB6 IDE and compiler.

**This is a work-in-progress project. This repository is for tracking bug reports and feature requests only.**
